My name is Jatin Shriyan and I run a music blog called 'Musicmandir'. You can have a look at it from the link - http://www.musicmandir.com/
The website showcases and promotes independent artists from India. I also encourage readers and listeners to purchase the artists music.
The website has been built completely on wordpress and I have designed it myself. I am looking at enhancing it further whenever I can find the time from my day time job. 
I work as in Marketing for a software consultancy building software for Banks.
